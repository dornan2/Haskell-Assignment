Haskell-Assignment
==================

This is a Haskell assignment that I completed in Third Year.

The assignment was to solve the balanced partition problem in Haskel. The program is designed to read in an arrray of integers and print out two subsets S1 and S2 such that the sum of the numbers in S1 is the smallest posible difference to the sum of the numbers in S2.
